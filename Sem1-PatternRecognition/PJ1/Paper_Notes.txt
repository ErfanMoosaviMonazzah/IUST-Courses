Intro
many algos proposed for binary classsifiction problem.
one of the strongest is svm.
traditionally svm solves multiclass problem by reducing the problem to 
multiple independant binary classifications.
this is not complete and very nice, since does not capture correlation
between classes.
But this paper provides a direct approach to learn multiclass
